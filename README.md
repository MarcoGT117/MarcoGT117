Hi! I'm Marco <br>
I started my journey into the web devolopement world in mid-2021. <br>
So far I feel confident on my HTML and CSS skills, and I've also collaberated in small projects using Java, Spring boot and MySQL while using Bootstrap on the frontend. <br>
Currently, I'm polishing my skills on JavaScript and learning React.js.<br>
I'm looking to colaborate with projects related to web developement, wether with small groups, as freelancer or companies, I'm open to everything!<br>
You can reach through my email marco.g.gleztorres@gmail.com or with a message on my LinkedIn profile <a>https://www.linkedin.com/in/marco-g-gonzalez/</a>.
